            <h3>Happy little trees</h3>
            <p>That'll be a challenge! Let's just do a painting that's fun. You have to make all these big decisions when you have power. All these fantastic things... they just sorta happen. You have to make friends with it. Anything that happens here, we can live with and we can turn it into something that looks pretty good most of the time. Follow these angles. </p>

            <p>Really be stingy with it. When I finally got to Alaska, whew boy, I just went crazy The smallest, very little amount. See? I knew you could do it! You have to make these big decisions in your world. Maybe I'll have a big mountain today. Life's wonderful, isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>It should give you a lot of ideas of a lot of crazy things you can do. The just do nice things for you. A very, very small amount. A place you want to go and run through bare-footed. You do it the way that you want it. We're looking for a nice, even distribution of color. Painters are expected to be different.
            </p>
            <p>Don't just cover it all up -- leave these spots! I like to be able to create my own world. I lived in Alaska for many, many years. People are so excited when they see this happen. You know me -- I love water. This is the lazy man's way of painting. Let's put in a happy little sky.
